# Module fabrikmc-igui

The Inventory GUI (`igui` in short) provides a high level **server-side** GUI API. You build the GUI using a
custom and easy-to-use builder DSL.

The GUI rerenders automatically if the state changes, it provides animations and "compounds" which are
an easy-to-use abstraction for listing a lot of elements of the same type.
