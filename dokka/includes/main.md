*Fabrik [[faˈbriːk]](https://cdn.duden.de/_media_/audio/ID4108073_10393000.mp3) (German for factory) is the place where
fabrics and quilts are produced.* <br>

### About

FabrikMC is an API for using [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/) with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). It is the
bridge between [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) and common Kotlin language features,
libraries, [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and more.

Additionally, FabrikMC offers you stable and simple APIs for common tasks in mod development.

### Setup with Gradle

Click on each module below to get started with it and to see how to use it in your build environment.

### Provide it at runtime

If you use FabrikMC, it must be available at runtime.

You can declare a dependency on the FabrikMC releases on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrik/versions)
or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabrik/files). <br> For users manually downloading your mod
you should advise them to download FabrikMC alongside your mod
(just as you would do it with the Fabric API for example).
