Click on each module below to get started with it and to see how to use it in your build environment.

### Prove it at runtime

If your use FabrikMC, it must be available at runtime.

You can declare a dependency on the FabrikMC releases on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrik/versions)
or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabrik/files). For users manually downloading your mods
you should advise them to also download FabrikMC as well (just as you would do it with the Fabric API for example).
